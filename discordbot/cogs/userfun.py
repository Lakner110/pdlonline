Ive finished around the top of the standings most (every? idk) seasons; BUT having lots of help from teammates shows me that i totally have things that i miss in prep that they help make up for. Cb zong is a perfect example from last week. Sure I was 1-0 that week but that bit of advice was very important. There was that one season i forfeit 2 games that didn't matter which makes my record look bad but the games i played that meant something i did well lol. Record shows im a good player. But even still i miss things in prep. Still have room for improvement")
